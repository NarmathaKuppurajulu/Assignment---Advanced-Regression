## General Information
- You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- From the above two techniques of Lasso and Ridge Regression, we can say that both almost having the same r2 value.
- When comparing the complexity, it is better to use Lasso because as we have 221 variables, Lasso will make the feature selection among the present variables, but Ridge will not reduce columns, it will keep all 221 variables with the reducing the coefficient of variables.
